# Breast Cancer Classification using Neural Networks

This repository contains code for building a neural network model to classify breast cancer data into malignant and benign tumors.

## Overview

The provided Jupyter Notebook (`breast_cancer_classification.ipynb`) demonstrates the following steps:
- Loading the breast cancer dataset from sklearn.
- Exploratory data analysis, including data visualization and summary statistics.
- Preprocessing the data by splitting into training and testing sets, standardizing features, and creating a neural network model.
- Training the model and evaluating its performance using accuracy metrics.
- Making predictions on sample input data and interpreting the results.

## Requirements

To run the code, you'll need:
- Python (3.x)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, TensorFlow

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `breast_cancer_classification.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter Notebook.
3. Execute each cell in the notebook sequentially to observe the steps and results.

## Files Included

- `breast_cancer_classification.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project.

## Acknowledgments

The code in this repository is part of a project to classify breast cancer tumors. It uses data from the sklearn.datasets module and TensorFlow/Keras for building a neural network model.
